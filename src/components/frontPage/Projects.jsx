                This section will eventually have a list of devblog posts for some projects I recently finished or am currently working on. My current goal is to work on a Chip-8 Emulator as I want to take the C skills I learned this last semester to do emulator development. I also have a few different web app ideas that I want to start on to expand on what I've learned making this site. Swift/iOS development is another interest of mine, so I'll just have to see what I end up working on.
